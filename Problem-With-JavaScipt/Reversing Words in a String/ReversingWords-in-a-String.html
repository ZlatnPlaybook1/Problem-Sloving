    <title>Reversing Words in a String</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- You need to write a function that reverses the words in a given string.
    A word can also fit an empty string. If this is not clear enough, here are
    some examples: As the input may have trailing spaces, you will also need to ignore unneccesary whitespace.
    Example:   "Hello World-- "World Hello"  ,,,"Hi There." --"There. Hi" -->
<script>
    function reversed(string){
        return string.split(" ").reverse().join(" ")
    }
    console.log(reversed("Hello World"))
</script>
